<h1>Zepto Data Analysis</h1>
The project uses Python with popular libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to clean the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generate key insights through visualizations.

Project Description
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the provided datasets, identify key trends, and extract actionable business metrics. The analysis pipeline includes:

Data Pre-processing: Combining and cleaning raw data from two different CSV files.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Calculating descriptive statistics and identifying data distributions.

Data Visualization: Creating a series of plots to visually represent key findings, such as product category distribution, discount trends, and price relationships.

Insight Generation: Filtering the data to answer specific business questions, like finding discounted or out-of-stock products.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need to have a Python environment with the following libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy

Data Files
The analysis relies on two CSV files:

zepto_v1.xlsx - Sheet1.csv

zepto_v2.csv

You must upload these two files to the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) before you can run the code.

Steps to Run the Project
Clone the Repository:
Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine or open it directly in a cloud environment like Google Colab.

Upload Data Files:
Place the two required CSV files (zepto_v1.xlsx - Sheet1.csv and zepto_v2.csv) in the same folder as the notebook file.

Open the Notebook:
Open Copy_of_Zepto_Data_Analysis_Project.ipynb in your preferred Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab).

Run the Cells:
Execute the code cells in the notebook sequentially, from top to bottom. The code is structured into four main steps:

Step 1: Data Pre-processing - Combines, cleans, and prepares the data.

Step 2: EDA - Performs statistical analysis.

Step 3: Visualization - Generates the plots.

Step 4: Insights - Provides filtered views of the data to answer business questions.

Code Overview
pandas: Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.

matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn: Used for creating a variety of informative plots and visualizations.

numpy: Used for numerical operations, although its usage is minimal in this particular script.
